# hex Grid

I was search for ways to create CSS scaleable hexagons for a while with mixed results.
After some soul searching I found a helpful stack overflow question herer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26114920/responsive-grid-of-hexagons
This stack thread then lead me in the directoin of this codepen:https://codepen.io/web-tiki/pen/NzYBYV
This codepen author is extremely talented. The code was clean and fairly easy to understand. I made modifactions to allow SVG and cetnered text to be used instaed of just an image.
