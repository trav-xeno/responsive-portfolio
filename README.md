# responsive-portfolio

This is a fully responsive and interactive version of my previous portfolio.
This project used scss and Materailize for foundatoins of the project.

# javascript

There is just some basic javascript used in the index.js file.
The file captures and prevents the form submission.
There is also a page load event listener that makes sure to Initialize materialize objects.

# scss/css

I used scss to do a quick start on my styling, and I wanted to get to know it more. I did end up mostly coding in css once I completed the initial design and setup.

# hex Grid

I searched for ways to create CSS scaleable hexagons layouts for a while with mixed results.
After some soul searching I found a helpful stack overflow question here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26114920/responsive-grid-of-hexagons
This stack thread then lead me in the direction of this codepen:https://codepen.io/web-tiki/pen/NzYBYV
This codepen author is extremely talented. The code was clean and fairly easy to understand. I made modifactions to allow SVG and cetnered text to be used instaed of just an image.
The paln will be to add inactions and descriptions to each demo as they get creaetd.
